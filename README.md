# Lab 7

## Task 1: LINQ Queries  
Create a C# console application to work with LINQ methods:

1. Create a class called Student with properties like Name, Age, and GPA.  
2. Create a list of Student objects with sample data.  
3. Use LINQ to sort the list of students by their GPA in descending order and print the sorted list.  
4. Use LINQ to filter and print students whose age is greater than or equal to 21.  
5. Use LINQ to find and print the student with the highest GPA.

## Task 2: LINQ Methods with Custom Objects
Extend Task 2 by adding more LINQ operations:

1. Add a property called "Courses" to the Student class, which is a list of strings representing the courses the student is enrolled in.  
2. Create a list of Student objects with sample data including their courses.  
3. Use LINQ to find and print students who are enrolled in a specific course (e.g., "Math").  
4. Use LINQ to find and print the courses that are taken by at least two students.  
5. Use LINQ to find and print the student(s) with the highest GPA in a specific course (e.g., "Physics").

## Task 3: More Advanced LINQ  
Create a C# console application to work with more advanced LINQ operations:

1. Create a list of integers with duplicate values.  
2. Use LINQ to remove duplicates from the list and print the result.  
3. Create two lists of strings and find the common elements between them using LINQ.  
4. Create a list of Person objects with properties like Name, Age, and Gender.  
5. Use LINQ to group the list of persons by their gender and print the count of persons in each group.

## Task 4: LINQ Method Chaining
Use method chaining with LINQ:

1. Create a list of strings containing names of fruits.  
2. Use LINQ to filter out fruits that contain the letter 'a', then convert the names to uppercase, and finally, print the result.  
3. Create a list of integers and use LINQ to calculate the sum of all even numbers in the list, then print the result.  
4. Create a list of Book objects with properties like Title, Author, and Price.  
5. Use LINQ to find and print the titles of the three most expensive books in the list.
